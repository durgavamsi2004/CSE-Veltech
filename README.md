# VV17 — Bankai Showcase Portal 🗡️

**VV17** is a visually immersive and responsive website dedicated to the legendary **Bankai** transformations from the anime **Bleach**.  
Each page dives deep into the soul-cutting power of a different Shinigami, capturing the essence of their Bankai through clean UI, lore-focused content, and a minimalist aesthetic.
